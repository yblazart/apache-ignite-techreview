Apache Ignite it's : ....

* First : the open Source version of GridGain Product.

Gridgain is the company that made Ignite and gave it to Apache fondation in 2014

== More than Just a memory Grid, or a distributed Db: Distributed caches 1/2 (storage)

[.column]
* Like InfiniSpan, Hazelcast, Redis...
* JCache provider (JSR 107)
* Caches can be :
    - Pure Memory, off Heap or on Heap
    - Persisted to local file storage with WAL files
    - Persisted to RDMS or other
* Data are stored in 'Binary' : you can change parts of object stored without change all object

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Off heap: no GC, huge amount of RAM
Native storage : on overhead, store on file, read when it's needed, restarting is easier
You can provide your own way to persist (API)
Warning BinFormat : hierarchy with properties and same name
--


== More than Just a memory Grid, or a distributed Db: Distributed caches 2/2 (distribution)

* Data are spread on multiple nodes, partitioned or replicated, by affinity Keys
* Data with same affinity Key value go to the same "node" -> collocation
* Near caches : on simple client also, updated by server nodes.

[NOTE.speaker]

For each cache we can define AffKey (compound by fields)
Data with same 'affinity hash' will be stored on same nodes (collocation)

== More than Just a memory Grid, or a distributed Db: SQL

[.column]
* Like YugaByte DB
* There is a layer to be able to do SQL over caches
 - You can have an H2 engine
 - There is also Apache calcite engine (beta)
 - Joins are possible (collocated/replicated)
* JDBC/ODBC driver provided
* When a client do a request, all nodes compute it and result is reduced

Partition/replicated -> Join in sql

[.columns]
== More than Just a memory Grid, or a distributed Db: Transactions

[.column]
* ACID and 2PC
* Compatible with JTA
* Not on all structures

== More than Just a memory Grid, or a distributed Db: Computing 1/3

--
* Like Hadoop
* You can send code to Nodes !
- Broadcast it
- Or select one or more node
- Get all results

IgniteCompute compute = ignite.compute();
for (String word : "Print words on different cluster nodes".split(" ")) {
    compute.run(() -> System.out.println(word));
}

[NOTE.speaker]
--
You can use lambda or Anonymous classes
Carefull between Jdk 11 and 17 with Lambda's, class loading

Ignite ignite = ...
long newYorkId = 2;
ignite.compute().affinityRun("City", newYorkId, new IgniteRunnable() {
  @IgniteInstanceResource Ignite ignite;
  @Override   public void run() {
    IgniteCache<BinaryObject, BinaryObject> people = ignite.cache("Person").withKeepBinary();
    ScanQuery<BinaryObject, BinaryObject> query = new ScanQuery <BinaryObject, BinaryObject>();
    try (QueryCursor<Cache.Entry<BinaryObject, BinaryObject>> cursor = people.query(query)) {
      for (Cache.Entry<BinaryObject, BinaryObject> entry : cursor) {
        BinaryObject personKey = entry.getKey();
        if (personKey.<Long>field("CITY_ID") == newYorkId) {
          person = entry.getValue();
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

== More than Just a memory Grid, or a distributed Db: Computing 3/3
--
* Runner,callable, Closure, Timeouts
* Fine selection of Node where it will be executed
* Map/Reduce API
* LoadBalancing
* Fault Tolerance
* Scheduling (FIFO or Priority or JobStealing)
* Collocating Job/Data

[.columns]
== More than Just a memory Grid, or a distributed Db: Service

[.column]
--
* Can be deployed as Cluster Singleton or Node Singleton
* Same way to select Nodes where to deploy it
* Redeployable
* Loadbalancing, Failover, and so on...
* Easy to use

[source, subs="verbatim,quotes"]
MyCounterService counterService = ignite
  .services()
  .serviceProxy("myCounterService",MyCounterService.class, false);
counterService.increment();

== More than Just a memory Grid, or a distributed Db: Messaging

--
* API to use Topics like in JMS
* Can create Local or Remote listeners, with node selection
* Messages can be ordered or not

== More than Just a memory Grid, or a distributed Db: Continuous Queries

--
* We can react to cache modifications
* With an InitalQuery
* Local or remote

== More than Just a memory Grid, or a distributed Db: Other possibilities

--
* Queues and Sets
* Atomic Types
* CountDownLatch
* Semaphore
* Sequence
* Locks
